BrainPOP UK widget to embed a learning video in your wordpress blog

== Description ==
BrainPOP UK is a KS2/KS3 & P3-P6/P7-S2 online subscription resource that delivers unique and highly engaging educational animations that make complex and challenging concepts accessible to children.

The movies are designed to encourage curiosity in kids in world around them and be a highly engaging, pedagogically strong starter or concept introduction resource for the educator.

Our POPbox Wordpress plugin will allow you to showcase the free featured movie of the day in your blog sidebar.

At significant points in the movies key vocabulary is displayed. Each movie is built in Flash, can be zoomed to fill the screen and lasts between 2.5-5 mins . a time span that is perfect for attention grabbing. They can be rewound/fast forwarded with no streaming pauses (as movies always pre-load).

It changes regularly and covers Science, Humanities, Maths, English, PSHE & Citizenship, Art and Design & Technology.
